# Spring Batch Architecture Agent (SBA)

> **⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS**: This project is actively being developed. APIs, file structures, and patterns may change.

A Claude Code plugin that guides you through designing and implementing enterprise-grade Spring Batch applications.

## Why SBA?

Designing Spring Batch applications involves countless decisions:

- **Which reader?** JdbcCursorItemReader vs JdbcPagingItemReader vs JpaPagingItemReader?
- **Chunk size?** 100? 1000? 10000? Depends on your data and infrastructure.
- **Fault tolerance?** Skip? Retry? What exceptions? What limits?
- **Parallelization?** Multi-threaded? Partitioned? Remote chunking?
- **Database optimization?** Batch inserts? Fetch size? Connection pooling?

**SBA encapsulates years of Spring Batch expertise into an AI agent** that:

1. **Asks the right questions** to understand your requirements
2. **Makes architecture decisions** based on your volume, constraints, and tech stack
3. **Applies proven patterns** for your specific use case
4. **Generates production-ready code** following best practices
5. **Reviews and optimizes** the final implementation

## The 5-Phase Workflow

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│  Discovery  │ ──▶ │ Architecture │ ──▶ │  Design  │ ──▶ │ Implementation │ ──▶ │  Review  │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────┘     └────────────────┘     └──────────┘
      │                    │                  │                   │                    │
      ▼                    ▼                  ▼                   ▼                    ▼
  Requirements         Decisions          Detailed           Working              Optimized
   Gathered              Made              Design             Code                Solution
```

| Phase | What Happens | Output |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Discovery** | Understand business requirements, data sources, volumes, constraints | Project context |
| **Architecture** | Choose patterns, persistence layer, parallelization strategy | 8 ADRs, tech stack |
| **Design** | Detail data models, step configurations, error handling | Design document |
| **Implementation** | Generate job configs, readers, processors, writers, tests | Production code |
| **Review** | Validate against best practices, optimize performance | Final solution |

## Installation

### Claude Code — Plugin (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Register the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add github:zakariahere/springbatch-sba

# 2. Install the plugin
/plugin install sba@sba-marketplace
```

Once installed, Claude automatically invokes the SBA agent when you mention Spring Batch. You can also trigger it explicitly:

```
/sba:sba migrate customer data from Oracle to PostgreSQL
```

### Other Editors — NPM Package

For GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other LLM-enabled editors:

```bash
# In your Spring Batch project directory
npx sba-init

# For GitHub Copilot
npx sba-init --type github

# For Cursor
npx sba-init --type cursor
```

### Manual Copy

Copy the `.claude/` directory from this repository into your project.

## Usage

### With the Plugin (Claude Code)

After installing the plugin:

1. **Natural language** — *"Help me design a Spring Batch job for customer data migration"*
2. **Slash command** — `/sba:sba [optional description]`
3. **Agent panel** — `/agents` → select `sba`

### With sba-init (Other Editors)

1. Run `npx sba-init` in your project directory
2. Open your editor and invoke the SBA agent
3. Say: *"Use the sba agent to help me design a Spring Batch job"*

### Quick Commands

During an SBA session:

```
sba status           Show current state and phase
sba next             Move to next phase
sba back             Return to previous phase
sba skip to {phase}  Jump to a specific phase
sba load skill {name} Load a specific skill
sba generate {artifact} Generate a specific artifact
```

## Token-Efficient Design

Claude Code has context limits. SBA uses **progressive loading**:

- Only the current phase is loaded (~4–15k tokens per phase)
- Skills are loaded on-demand based on your tech choices
- Templates are loaded just-in-time during implementation

This keeps the agent responsive and focused while having access to a comprehensive knowledge base.

## Supported Technologies

### Persistence Layers
- **JDBC** — Direct cursor and paging readers, batch inserts (recommended for large volumes)
- **MyBatis** — XML and annotation-based mappers
- **JPA/Hibernate** — With batch optimization patterns

### Databases
- **PostgreSQL** — With specific optimizations (COPY, advisory locks)
- **Oracle** — Including partitioning and parallel hints
- *(MySQL, SQL Server coming soon)*

### Patterns & Skills
- Chunk-oriented processing
- Tasklet-based steps
- Partitioning (parallel processing)
- Fault tolerance (skip/retry/restart)
- Multi-threaded steps
- Conditional flows
- Job composition
- Listeners and monitoring
