# Spring Batch Architecture Agent (SBA)

> **⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS**: This project is actively being developed. APIs, file structures, and patterns may change.

A powerful AI agent system for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) that guides you through designing and implementing enterprise-grade Spring Batch applications.

## Why SBA?

Designing Spring Batch applications involves countless decisions:

- **Which reader?** JdbcCursorItemReader vs JdbcPagingItemReader vs JpaPagingItemReader?
- **Chunk size?** 100? 1000? 10000? Depends on your data and infrastructure.
- **Fault tolerance?** Skip? Retry? What exceptions? What limits?
- **Parallelization?** Multi-threaded? Partitioned? Remote chunking?
- **Database optimization?** Batch inserts? Fetch size? Connection pooling?

**SBA encapsulates years of Spring Batch expertise into an AI agent** that:

1. **Asks the right questions** to understand your requirements
2. **Makes architecture decisions** based on your volume, constraints, and tech stack
3. **Applies proven patterns** for your specific use case
4. **Generates production-ready code** following best practices
5. **Reviews and optimizes** the final implementation

## The 5-Phase Workflow

SBA guides you through a structured process:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│  Discovery  │ ──▶ │ Architecture │ ──▶ │  Design  │ ──▶ │ Implementation │ ──▶ │  Review  │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────┘     └────────────────┘     └──────────┘
      │                    │                  │                   │                    │
      ▼                    ▼                  ▼                   ▼                    ▼
  Requirements         Decisions          Detailed           Working              Optimized
   Gathered              Made              Design             Code                Solution
```

| Phase | What Happens | Output |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Discovery** | Understand business requirements, data sources, volumes, constraints | Project context |
| **Architecture** | Choose patterns, persistence layer, parallelization strategy | ADRs, tech stack |
| **Design** | Detail data models, step configurations, error handling | Design document |
| **Implementation** | Generate job configs, readers, processors, writers, tests | Production code |
| **Review** | Validate against best practices, optimize performance | Final solution |

## Token-Efficient Design

Claude Code has context limits (64k-128k tokens). SBA uses **progressive loading**:

- Only the current phase is loaded (~4-15k tokens)
- Skills are loaded on-demand based on your tech choices
- Templates are loaded just-in-time during implementation

This keeps the agent responsive and focused while having access to comprehensive knowledge.

## Supported Technologies

### Persistence Layers
- **JPA/Hibernate** - With batch optimization patterns
- **MyBatis** - XML and annotation-based mappers
- **JDBC** - Direct JDBC with cursor and paging readers

### Databases
- **PostgreSQL** - With specific optimizations
- **Oracle** - Including partitioning and hints
- *(MySQL, SQL Server coming soon)*

### Patterns & Skills
- Chunk-oriented processing
- Tasklet-based steps
- Partitioning (parallel processing)
- Fault tolerance (skip/retry/restart)
- Multi-threaded steps
- Conditional flows
- Job composition
- Listeners and monitoring

## Installation

### Option 1: NPM Package (Recommended)

```bash
# In your Spring Batch project directory
npx sba-init

# Or with options
npx sba-init --force --verbose
```

### Option 2: Manual Copy

Copy the `.claude/` directory from this repository into your project.

## Usage

1. **Start Claude Code** in your project directory:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

2. **Invoke the SBA agent** in any of these ways:
   - Natural: *"Help me design a Spring Batch job for customer data migration"*
   - Explicit: *"Use the sba agent to create an ETL batch job"*
   - Command: `/agents` → select `sba`

3. **Follow the phases**. The agent will guide you through discovery, architecture, design, implementation, and review.

### Quick Commands

During an SBA session:
- `sba status` - Show current state and phase
- `sba next` - Move to next phase
- `sba back` - Return to previous phase
- `sba load skill {name}` - Load a specific skill
